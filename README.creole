== QuickShop ==
== The Predecessors ==
Showcase was abandoned.  Chestshop needed a display, with signs whose order you could never remember. SCS has too many commands. I'm yet to find someone who uses essentials shops.

Don't get me wrong though, they're all awesome plugins each in a few ways. 
\\
\\
== A Warning ==
As much as I want this plugin to succeed, it does involve cloning (Duping) items, and disabling them from being picked up.  If something goes wrong, you may have an item dupe on your hands. I have tried my best to dupe the items in latest versions, however I've had no success, and run every build with a chance of item dupe on my server of 10 players (average) before releasing it.  If you succeed in duping (Within reason...), tell me how you did it in a ticket.  I do **NOT **recommend using this on big servers just yet!
\\
\\
== QuickShop ==
So, I set out to write this.  QuickShop.  QuickShop is a shop plugin, that allows players to sell items from a chest with no commands.  It allows players to purchase any number of items easily.  In fact, this plugin doesn't even have any commands that a player would ever need!
\\
\\
== Features ==
* Vault Support
* Easy to use
* Easy to remember
* Quick (Oh, really?)
* Display Item on top of chest

Hi, I'm an 18 year old University student studying Software Engineering.  I spend my time writing code that I receive practically no reward for other than people asking questions I've answered a hundred times before.  I know server Admin's and Owners aren't the richest of people - But if you're feeling particularly generous, I always appreciate any amount for the time and patience I put into coding Bukkit plugins.
